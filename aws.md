AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):

EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to rent virtual servers (known as instances) and run applications on them.
With EC2, you have full control over the virtual servers. You can choose the instance type, operating system, networking configuration, and storage options.
EC2 instances are typically used for applications that require long-running, steady-state servers, such as web servers, databases, and enterprise applications.
Users are responsible for managing the operating system, software updates, security configurations, and scaling of EC2 instances.


AWS Lambda:

Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by AWS. It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
With Lambda, you upload your code (in the form of functions) and AWS takes care of executing that code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, changes to data in databases, or messages from other AWS services.
Lambda automatically scales your code by running it in response to each event. You only pay for the compute time consumed by your code.
Lambda is commonly used for event-driven applications, real-time file processing, data processing pipelines, and backend services for mobile and web applications.
Unlike EC2, Lambda abstracts away server management, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code.

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Retrieve the JSON body from the event
    try:
        event_body = json.loads(event['body'])
        print("Received body:", event_body)
    except KeyError:
        print("No 'body' key found in the event")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Error decoding JSON body")

    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)
